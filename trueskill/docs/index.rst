What's TrueSkill?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TrueSkill_ is a rating system among game players. It was developed by
`Microsoft Research`_ and has been used on `Xbox LIVE`_ for ranking and
matchmaking service. This system quantifies players' **TRUE** skill points by
the Bayesian inference algorithm. It also works well with any type of match
rule including N:N team game or free-for-all.

This project is a Python package which implements the TrueSkill rating
system::

   from trueskill import Rating, quality_1vs1, rate_1vs1
   alice, bob = Rating(25), Rating(30)  # assign Alice and Bob's ratings
   if quality_1vs1(alice, bob) < 0.50:
       print('This match seems to be not so fair')
   alice, bob = rate_1vs1(alice, bob)  # update the ratings after the match

Rating, the model for skill
---------------------------

In TrueSkill, rating is a Gaussian distribution which starts from
:math:`\mathcal{ N }( 25, \frac{ 25 }{ 3 }^2 )`. :math:`\mu` is an average
skill of player, and :math:`\sigma` is a confidence of the guessed rating. A
real skill of player is between :math:`\mu \pm 2\sigma` with 95% confidence. ::

   >>> from trueskill import Rating
   >>> Rating()  # use the default mu and sigma
   trueskill.Rating(mu=25.000, sigma=8.333)

If some player's rating is higher :math:`\beta` than another player's, the
player may have about 75.6% of chance to beat the other player. The default
value of :math:`\beta` is :math:`\frac{ 25 }{ 6 }`.

Ratings will approach real skills through few times of the TrueSkill's Bayesian
inference algorithm. How many matches TrueSkill needs to estimate real skills?
It depends on the game rule. See the below table:

================  =======
Rule              Matches
================  =======
16P free-for-all  3
8P free-for-all   3
4P free-for-all   5
2P free-for-all   12
2:2:2:2           10
4:4:4:4           20
4:4               46
8:8               91

Head-to-head (1 vs. 1) match rule
---------------------------------

Most competition games follows 1:1 match rule. If your game does, just use
``_1vs1`` shortcuts containing :func:`rate_1vs1` and :func:`quality_1vs1`.
These are very easy to use.

First of all, we need 2 :class:`Rating` objects::

   >>> r1 = Rating()  # 1P's skill
   >>> r2 = Rating()  # 2P's skill

Then we can guess match quality which is equivalent with draw probability of
this match using :func:`quality_1vs1`::

   >>> print('{:.1%} chance to draw'.format(quality_1vs1(r1, r2)))
   44.7% chance to draw

After the game, TrueSkill recalculates their ratings by the game result. For
example, if 1P beat 2P::

   >>> new_r1, new_r2 = rate_1vs1(r1, r2)
   >>> print(new_r1)
   trueskill.Rating(mu=29.396, sigma=7.171)
   >>> print(new_r2)
   trueskill.Rating(mu=20.604, sigma=7.171)

Mu value follows player's win/draw/lose records. Higher value means higher game
skill. And sigma value follows the number of games. Lower value means many game
plays and higher rating confidence.

So 1P, a winner's skill grew up from 25 to 29.396 but 2P, a loser's skill shrank
to 20.604. And both sigma values became narrow about same magnitude.

Of course, you can also handle a tie game with ``drawn=True``::

   >>> new_r1, new_r2 = rate_1vs1(r1, r2, drawn=True)
   >>> print(new_r1)
   trueskill.Rating(mu=25.000, sigma=6.458)
   >>> print(new_r2)
   trueskill.Rating(mu=25.000, sigma=6.458)

Other match rules
-----------------

There are many other match rules such as N:N team match, N:N:N multiple team
match, N:M unbalanced match, free-for-all (Player vs. All), and so on. Mostly
other rating systems cannot work with them but TrueSkill does. TrueSkill
accepts any types of matches.

We should arrange ratings into a group by their team::

   >>> r1 = Rating()  # 1P's skill
   >>> r2 = Rating()  # 2P's skill
   >>> r3 = Rating()  # 3P's skill
   >>> t1 = [r1]  # Team A contains just 1P
   >>> t2 = [r2, r3]  # Team B contains 2P and 3P

Then we can calculate the match quality and rate them::

   >>> print('{:.1%} chance to draw'.format(quality([t1, t2])))
   13.5% chance to draw
   >>> (new_r1,), (new_r2, new_r3) = rate([t1, t2], ranks=[0, 1])
   >>> print(new_r1)
   trueskill.Rating(mu=33.731, sigma=7.317)
   >>> print(new_r2)
   trueskill.Rating(mu=16.269, sigma=7.317)
   >>> print(new_r3)
   trueskill.Rating(mu=16.269, sigma=7.317)

If you want to describe other game results, set the ``ranks`` argument like the
below examples:

- A drawn game -- ``ranks=[0, 0]``
- Team B won not team A -- ``ranks=[1, 0]`` (Lower rank is better)

Additionally, here are varied patterns of rating groups. All variables which
start with ``r`` are :class:`Rating` objects:

- N:N team match -- ``[(r1, r2, r3), (r4, r5, r6)]``
- N:N:N multiple team match -- ``[(r1, r2), (r3, r4), (r5, r6)]``
- N:M unbalanced match -- ``[(r1,), (r2, r3, r4)]``
- Free-for-all -- ``[(r1,), (r2,), (r3,), (r4,)]``

Partial play
------------

Let's assume that there are 2 teams which each has 2 players. The game was for
a hour but the one of players on the first team entered the game at 30 minutes
later.

If some player wasn't present for the entire duration of the game, use the
concept of "partial play" by ``weights`` parameter. The above situation can be
described by the following weights:

.. hlist::
   - 1P on team A -- 1.0 = Full time
   - 2P on team A -- 0.5 = :math:`\frac{ 30 }{ 60 }` minutes
   - 3P on team B -- 1.0
   - 4P on team B -- 1.0

As a code with a 2-dimensional list::

   # set each weights to 1, 0.5, 1, 1
   rate([(r1, r2), (r3, r4)], weights=[(1, 0.5), (1, 1)])
   quality([(r1, r2), (r3, r4)], weights=[(1, 0.5), (1, 1)])

Or with a dictionary::

   # set a weight of 2nd player in 1st team to 0.5, otherwise leave as 1
   rate([(r1, r2), (r3, r4)], weights={(0, 1): 0.5})
   quality([(r1, r2), (r3, r4)], weights={(0, 1): 0.5})

Backends
--------

The TrueSkill algorithm uses :math:`\Phi`, `the cumulative distribution
function`_; :math:`\phi`, `the probability density function`_; and
:math:`\Phi^{-1}`, the inverse cumulative distribution function. But standard
mathematics library doesn't provide the functions. Therefore this package
implements them.

Meanwhile, there are third-party libraries which implement the functions. You
may want to use another implementation because that's more expert. Then set
``backend`` option of :class:`TrueSkill` to the backend you chose:

>>> TrueSkill().cdf  # internal implementation
<function cdf at ...>
>>> TrueSkill(backend='mpmath').cdf  # mpmath.ncdf
<bound method MPContext.f_wrapped of <mpmath.ctx_mp.MPContext object at ...>>

Here's the list of the available backends:

- ``None`` -- the internal implementation. (Default)
- "mpmath" -- requires mpmath_ installed.
- "scipy" -- requires scipy_ installed.

.. note::

   When winners have too lower rating than losers, :meth:`TrueSkill.rate` will
   raise :exc:`FloatingPointError`. In this case, you need higher
   floating-point precision. The mpmath library offers flexible floating-point
   precision. You can solve the problem with mpmath as a backend and higher
   precision setting.
