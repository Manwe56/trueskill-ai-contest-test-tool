Version 0.4.1
-------------

Released on Jun 6th 2013.

- Deprecates :func:`dynamic_draw_probability`.

Version 0.4
-----------

Released on Mar 25th 2013.

- Supports dynamic draw probability.
- Replaces :meth:`Rating.exposure` with :meth:`TrueSkiil.expose`. Because the
  TrueSkill settings have to adjust a fomula to calculate an exposure.
- Deprecates head-to-head shortcut methods in :class:`TrueSkill`. The top-level
  shortcut functions are still alive.

Version 0.3.1
-------------

Released on Mar 6th 2013.

Raises :exc:`FloatingPointError` instead of :exc:`ValueError` (math domain
error) for a problem similar to `issue #5`_ but with more extreme input.

Version 0.3
-----------

Released on Mar 5th 2013.

:class:`TrueSkill` got a new option ``backend`` to choose cdf, pdf, ppf
implementation.

When winners have too lower rating than losers, :meth:`TrueSkill.rate` will
raise :exc:`FloatingPointError` if the backend is ``None`` or "scipy". But from
this version, you can avoid the problem with "mpmath" backend. This was
reported at `issue #5`_.

  player's rating simply.
- Adds shorcut functions for 2 players individual match, the most usage:
  :func:`rate_1vs1` and :func:`quality_1vs1`,
